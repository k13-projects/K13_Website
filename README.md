# K13 Software Studio: Brand & Website Kit

*Software with an edge. Crafted with care.*

## The identity

K13 is a **typographic brand**. The wordmark is set in Fraunces: a bold ink **K** and an
orange **13**, with a JetBrains Mono "SOFTWARE STUDIO" tag beside it, exactly as the
site's top nav renders it. The favicon is the same idea reduced to a tile (white
background in both color schemes, on purpose).

There is no glyph or badge mark. A rounded-square mark existed once and was retired for
good on 2026-08-18 (see `CLAUDE.md`, Settled decisions). Do not recreate one.

## Palette

The tokens `index.html` actually runs on (curated 2026-08-19):

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--ink` | `#141D35` | base navy |
| `--ink-2` | `#2A3554` | elevated navy |
| `--paper` | `#F3F5FA` | the field |
| `--paper-2` | `#FFFFFF` | cards |
| `--paper-3` | `#E9EDF7` | lines |
| `--blue` | `#B94612` | accent, deep |
| `--blue-2` | `#EA5E14` | accent, bright |
| `--faint` | `#646B7E` | muted labels |
| `--muted` | `#515C78` | muted text |
| `--wash-blue` | `#FCE0CC` | wash |
| `--wash-lilac` | `#E8E1FB` | wash |
| `--wash-mint` | `#D6F0E6` | wash |
| `--wash-peach` | `#FBE6DD` | wash |

## Type

Three families, three jobs, nothing else:

- **Fraunces** carries display: headlines, the wordmark, accent italics.
- **Inter** carries body text.
- **JetBrains Mono** carries labels, tags, and small tracked-uppercase lines.

All are free on Google Fonts.

## Contact

All inquiries route to **projects.k13@gmail.com** (form and mailto links are wired to it).

## Hooking up k13projects.com

The site is one static file, so any host works:

1. **Vercel (current setup):** the repo is imported as the `k13-website` project;
   `main` serves production and branch subdomains (b1, b2, ...) serve stakeholder previews.
2. **Any shared host:** upload `index.html` to the web root. Done.

To change the contact address later, search for `projects.k13@gmail.com` in
`index.html` and replace all occurrences.
